# Gradient-Descent-Example
Dependancies:
  numpy - For matrix math
  matplotlib - To graph the cost function and solution
  
An Example implementation of the gradient descent algorithm written in python.

The Absorbancy_Data.dat file contains absorbancy data for chlorophyll which I
collected in my chemistry class. The file gd.py will run and produce first a
graph of the cost function history for the gradient descent and then a graph
showing the data and the linear regression of the data.
